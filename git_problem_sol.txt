Problem: 1

Pushing to Git returning Error Code 403 fatal: HTTP request failed:

Solution:


I just got the same problem and just figured out what's cause.

Github seems only supports ssh way to read&write the repo, although https way also displayed 'Read&Write'.

So you need to change your repo config on your PC to ssh way:

    edit .git/config file under your repo directory
    find url=entry under section [remote "origin"]
    change it from url=https://MichaelDrogalis@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git to url=ssh://git@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git. that is, change all the texts before @ symbol to ssh://git
    Save config file and quit. now you could use git push origin master to sync your repo on GitHub




Problem: 2

Git - Permission denied (publickey)


1. First start by setting up your own public/private key pair set. This can
use either DSA or RSA, so basically any key you setup will work. On most
systems you can use ssh-keygen.

    First you'll want to cd into your .ssh directory. Open up the terminal and
run:

        cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen



2. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard

 When copying your key, don't add any newlines or
whitespace.

$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

Tip: If clip isn't working, you can locate the hidden .ssh folder, open the
file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.

3.
Finally setup your .gitconfig.

    git config --global user.name "bob"
    git config --global user.email bob@... (don't forget to restart your
command line to make sure the config is reloaded)




Problem: 3

git error: failed to push some refs to:


Solution:
	



git pull --rebase
git push

The full syntax is:

git pull --rebase origin master
git push origin master

That way, you would replay (the --rebase part) your local commits on top of
the newly updated origin/master (or origin/yourBranch: git pull origin
yourBranch).

See a more complete example in the chapter 6 Pull with rebase of the Git
Pocket Book.

I would recommend a:

git push -u origin master

That would establish a tracking relationship between your local master branch
and its upstream branch.
After that, any future push for that branch can be done with a simple:

git push

See "Why do I need to explicitly push a new branch?".

Since the OP already reset and redone its commit on top of origin/master:

git reset --mixed origin/master
git add .
git commit -m "This is a new commit for what I originally planned to be
amended"
git push origin master

There is no need to pull --rebase.

Note: git reset --mixed origin/master can also be written git reset
origin/master, since the --mixed option is the default one when using git
reset.
